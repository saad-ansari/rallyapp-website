        <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

        <h2>What is Rally?</h2>
        <p>
          Rally is a social accountability app that tracks who actually shows up
          to events. Create squads with your friends, plan events, and build
          your Reliability Score based on your attendance.
        </p>

        <h2>What is a Reliability Score?</h2>
        <p>
          Your Reliability Score is a measure of how often you follow through on
          your commitments. When you RSVP "Yes" to an event and show up, your
          score goes up. If you bail without notice, it goes down. It's a fun
          way to see who in your friend group is truly reliable.
        </p>

        <h2>How is my Reliability Score calculated?</h2>
        <p>Your score is based on:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Events you RSVP "Yes" to</li>
          <li>Whether you checked in or attended those events</li>
          <li>How often and when you cancel after committing</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Early cancellations have less impact than last-minute bail-outs. The
          more events you attend, the more accurate your score becomes.
        </p>

        <h2>Who can see my Reliability Score?</h2>
        <p>
          Your score is only visible to members of your squads and hosts of
          events you RSVP to. It is not publicly visible to anyone outside your
          squads.
        </p>

        <h2>What is a Squad?</h2>
        <p>
          A Squad is a group of friends or people who regularly hang out
          together. You can create squads for different friend groups, sports
          teams, book clubs, or any recurring gathering. Each squad has its own
          events and leaderboard.
        </p>

        <h2>How do I check in to an event?</h2>
        <p>
          When you arrive at an event location, open Rally and tap the check-in
          button. The app uses your location to verify you're actually at the
          venue. This prevents fake check-ins and keeps scores honest.
        </p>

        <h2>What if I can't make an event after RSVPing?</h2>
        <p>
          Life happens! If you need to cancel, do it as early as possible
          through the app. Early cancellations have minimal impact on your
          score. Last-minute cancellations or no-shows will affect your
          Reliability Score more significantly.
        </p>

        <h2>Is Rally free to use?</h2>
        <p>
          Yes, Rally is free to download and use. We may introduce optional
          premium features in the future, but the core functionality will always
          be free.
        </p>

        <h2>How do I delete my account?</h2>
        <p>
          You can delete your account from within the app by going to Settings
          &gt; Account &gt; Delete Account. You can also request account
          deletion by emailing
          <a href="mailto:support@rallyapp.me">support@rallyapp.me</a>.
        </p>

        <h2>How do I report a problem or get help?</h2>
        <p>
          For support, you can reach us at
          <a href="mailto:support@rallyapp.me">support@rallyapp.me</a> or use
          the in-app help feature under Settings &gt; Help & Support.
        </p>

        <h2>Is my data safe?</h2>
        <p>
          Yes, we take data security seriously. All data is encrypted in transit
          and at rest. We only collect the information necessary to provide the
          service. Read our

          permitted to create accounts.
