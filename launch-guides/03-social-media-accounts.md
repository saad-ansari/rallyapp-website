# Step 3: Social Media Accounts Setup
**⏱️ Time:** 3-4 hours (spread over 3-4 days)  
**💰 Cost:** $0  
**🟢 Priority:** HIGH - Start Week 1, ramp up Week 2+

---

## Platform Priority Order

**Do these in this exact order:**

1. **Twitter/X** (Brand account) - Week 1, Day 4-5
2. **Instagram** (Brand account) - Week 1, Day 5-6
3. **TikTok** (Brand account) - Week 1, Day 6-7
4. **Reddit** (Personal account first) - Week 1, Day 7
5. **LinkedIn** (Company page) - Week 2
6. **Discord** (Community server) - Week 2
7. **Facebook** (Brand page) - Week 3 (low priority)

**Why this order:** TikTok has highest virality potential for Rally's "flaky friend" content. Twitter for founder story. Instagram for brand presence.

### TikTok Content Strategy (HIGHEST PRIORITY)

**Why TikTok first:** Rally's "flaky friend" pain point is PERFECT for TikTok's POV/skit format. One video can hit 100K+ views.

**Post Frequency:** 5-7x/week (TikTok favors frequency)

**Content Ideas:**

**POV Skits (3x/week):**
- "POV: Your friend with 20% reliability score saying 'I'll be there'"
- "When you check your squad's reliability scores before making plans"
- "That one friend who's always Platinum tier vs. the Starter tier friend"
- "Me explaining to my flaky friend why their score dropped to Bronze"

**Format:**
- 15-30 seconds
- Trending audio (check TikTok Discover page)
- Text overlay in first 1 second
- Expressive reactions (you or wife acting)

**Feature Demos (2x/week):**
- "How Rally works in 30 seconds"
- "What happens when someone doesn't show up? (Watch their score drop)"
- "The satisfaction of hitting Platinum tier 💎"

**Engagement Bait (1x/week):**
- "What's your reliability score? Comment below 👇"
- "Tag your flaky friend who needs Rally"

**Hashtags:** #flakyriends #reliabilitymatters #squadgoals #friendshipgoals #makeplans + 1-2 trending

## Part 4: Reddit Accounts

### Personal Account (IMPORTANT: Not Rally-Branded)

**1. Go to:** [reddit.com/register](https://reddit.com/register)

**2. Create Account:**
- **Username:** Something generic, NOT rally-related
  - Examples: uk_dev_2025, london_techie, buildinginpublic_jan

- r/reactnative (if you share tech stack)

**4. Build Karma (CRITICAL):**
- **You need 50+ karma before posting about Rally**
- Comment genuinely on 20+ posts in first 2 weeks
- Upvote helpful content
- Don't mention Rally for first month
- **Why:** Reddit hates self-promotion. Build trust first.

**Status:** ☐ Reddit personal account created, 50+ karma earned
