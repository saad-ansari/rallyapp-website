# Launch System: Guides + Agents

This document explains how Rally's **launch guides** (step-by-step instructions) and **agent system** (expert consultants) work together.

## 🎯 When to Use What

### Use Launch Guides When...
- You want **actionable checklists** ("Do this, then this")
- You need **templates** (app descriptions, tweets, emails)
- You're **executing tasks** (creating accounts, uploading builds)
- You want **time estimates** ("This takes 3-4 hours")

### Use Agent System When...
- You have **questions** ("Should I prioritize TikTok or Instagram first?")
- You need **decisions made** ("Is this a good Product Hunt tagline?")
- You want **strategy** ("How do I get my first 100 users?")
- You're **stuck** ("My app was rejected, what do I do?")

## 💡 Pro Tips

**1. Guides first, agents second**
- Execute with guides → Validate with agents
- Don't ask agents "How do I create a Twitter account?" (guides cover this)
- DO ask agents "What should I post on Twitter?" (strategic decision)

**2. Agents complement each other**
- Mentor → Routes you to right specialist
- Specialists → Deep dive on their domain
- Example: "Mentor: 'For TikTok strategy, consult Content Specialist'" → "Content Specialist: 'Here are 20 video ideas'"

**3. Use guides as checklists during agent conversations**
- Agent gives strategy → You execute using guide's checklist
- Example: "Agent: 'Do keyword research' → You: Follow [Guide 04, Step 1] for exact steps"

**4. Agents adapt, guides are fixed**
- Guides = proven process (doesn't change)
- Agents = custom advice for your situation
- Example: Guide says "Launch Wednesday", Agent says "Delay 1 week because of beta bugs"

## ❓ Common Questions

**Q: Should I read all guides first or execute one at a time?**
A: Read [00-LAUNCH-MASTER-PLAN.md](00-LAUNCH-MASTER-PLAN.md) for overview, then execute guides sequentially (1 → 2 → 3 → etc).

**Q: When should I consult the Mentor vs. a specialist?**
A: Start with Mentor for general questions ("What should I prioritize?"). Mentor routes you to specialists for deep expertise ("For TikTok content, consult Content Specialist").

**Q: Can I skip guides and just ask agents?**
A: Guides provide structure + save time (pre-written templates, checklists). Agents provide customization + problem-solving. Use both for best results.

**Q: What if a guide is outdated (e.g., Apple changes their process)?**
A: Consult [Mentor](../.github/agents/mentor.agent.md) → "Apple Developer signup changed, can you update me?" → Mentor provides current process or routes to Launch Strategist.

**Q: I'm in Week 5 but didn't finish Week 3 tasks. What do I do?**
A: Consult [Launch Strategist](../.github/agents/launch-strategist.agent.md) → "I'm behind schedule, should I delay launch or deprioritize some tasks?" → Get custom timeline.

**Remember:** Guides tell you **what to do**. Agents tell you **how to do it well**. Use both! 🚀
