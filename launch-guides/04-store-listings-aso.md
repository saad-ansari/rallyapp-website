## What Is ASO (App Store Optimization)?

ASO is **SEO for app stores**. It's how people discover Rally when searching "reliability app", "squad planner", "friend tracker", etc.

**Goal:** Rank in top 10 for target keywords → Get organic downloads without ads.

**Two components:**
1. **Keyword Research** - What people search for
2. **Store Listing** - How Rally appears in search results

---

## Part 1: Keyword Research (Do This First!)

### Step 1: Brainstorm Seed Keywords

Write down 20+ phrases Rally users might search:

**Your list:**
- "reliability tracker"
- "squad app"
- "friend planner"
- "group event app"
- "who's coming app"
- "flaky friend solution"
- "social accountability"
- "friend scorecard"
- "group coordination"
- "event RSVP tracker"
- [Add 10+ more based on Rally's features]

---

### Step 2: Check Keyword Volume & Competition

**Use these FREE tools:**

**1. AppTweak (Free Trial):**
- [apptweak.com](https://www.apptweak.com/)
- Sign up for free trial (no credit card for 7 days)
- Enter each keyword → See search volume + difficulty
- **Goal:** Find 5-10 keywords with 1K-10K monthly searches + low competition

**2. Sensor Tower (Free Basic):**
- [sensortower.com/aso](https://sensortower.com/aso)
- Search "reliability" or "squad" → See what apps rank for those terms
- Check their keyword strategy (what's in their titles?)

**3. Manual Method (100% Free):**
- Open App Store → Search "reliability"
- Notice autocomplete suggestions (these are high-volume searches)
- Screenshot the dropdown - these are your keywords!

**Example findings:**
- "reliability app" - 500 searches/month, LOW competition ✅
- "squad planner" - 2K searches/month, MEDIUM competition ✅
- "friend tracker" - 5K searches/month, HIGH competition ❌ (too competitive)

---

### Step 3: Prioritize Your Keywords

**Create a spreadsheet:**

| Keyword | Volume | Difficulty | Relevance | Priority |
|---------|--------|------------|-----------|----------|
| reliability tracker | 800 | Low | Perfect | ⭐⭐⭐ |
| squad planner | 2K | Medium | Great | ⭐⭐⭐ |
| group event app | 5K | High | Good | ⭐⭐ |
| friend scorecard | 200 | Low | Perfect | ⭐⭐ |

**Choose your PRIMARY keyword** (most important):
- Rally's PRIMARY: **"reliability tracker"** or **"squad planner"**

**Choose 5 SECONDARY keywords** (also important):
1. reliability app
2. friend planner
3. group event
4. squad coordination
5. social accountability

**Status:** ☐ Keyword research complete (10 prioritized keywords)

1. **Track who shows up to plans** (28 chars) ⭐

```

**(171 chars - trim to 170)**

**Your promotional text:** ______________________________

---

### Step 5: Write Description (4,000 Characters Max)

**Formula:**
1. Hook (1 sentence pain point)
2. Solution (what Rally does)
3. Key features (bullets)
4. Social proof (when available)

**Copy-Paste Ready Template:**

```
HOW MANY TIMES HAS A FRIEND SAID "I'LL BE THERE" AND NEVER SHOWED UP?

Rally tracks who actually shows up to plans. No more flaky friends, no more empty promises. Build your Reliability Score, prove you're someone people can count on, and make showing up matter.

CORE FEATURES

🏁 RALLY CREATION
Create events with RSVP thresholds (e.g., "Coffee if 3+ people commit"). Set location, time, and stakes. Your squad sees who's in.

✅ CHECK-IN SYSTEM
Prove you showed up. Check in when you arrive (location-verified). Late? Your score takes a hit. No-shows? Even worse.

📊 RELIABILITY SCORES
Earn tiers from Starter → Bronze → Silver → Gold → Platinum. Your score follows you everywhere. It's your social credit score.

🏆 LEADERBOARDS
Compete with your squad, your city, or globally. See who's the most reliable. Bragging rights matter.

👥 SQUADS
Invite your close friends. See their scores before making plans. Know who to count on.

🔔 SMART NOTIFICATIONS
Reminders 24 hours before, 1 hour before. Check-in window opens 15 minutes early. Never miss a rally.

WHY RALLY?

Traditional group chats let people bail without consequence. Rally makes reliability visible, measurable, and social. Your score is your reputation.

Perfect for:
• Friend groups tired of flaky plans
• Sports teams tracking attendance
• Book clubs managing commitment
• Roommates coordinating schedules
• Any group that values showing up

HOW IT WORKS

1. Create your squad (or join one)
2. Someone creates a Rally with an RSVP threshold
3. Squad members commit (or don't)
4. Threshold met? Rally happens.
5. Check in when you arrive
6. Earn points → climb tiers → dominate leaderboards

Your Reliability Score = (Rallies Attended ÷ Rallies Committed) × 100

Simple. Transparent. Unforgiving.

BUILT FOR THE RELIABLE

Rally rewards consistency. Show up once, your score jumps. Show up 10 times in a row, you hit Platinum. No-show once? Back to Bronze. Your tier is earned, not given.

From late-night taco runs to morning gym sessions, Rally makes sure the people who say "I'm in" actually show up.

COMING SOON
• Voice rallies (impromptu plans)
• Bet stakes (winner takes all)

Make showing up matter. 🏁
