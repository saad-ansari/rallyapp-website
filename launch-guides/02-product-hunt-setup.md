# Step 2: Product Hunt Setup & Engagement
**⏱️ Time:** 30 mins setup + 10 mins daily (8 weeks)  
**💰 Cost:** $0  
**🟡 Priority:** HIGH - Start NOW (need 2-3 months activity before launch)

---

## Why Product Hunt Matters

Product Hunt can drive **1,000-5,000+ downloads** on launch day if done right. But the algorithm heavily weights upvotes from **active community members**. If you create an account the day before launch, your upvotes won't count much.

**The 2-Month Rule:** Engage for 2-3 months before launching = your network reciprocates on launch day.

**Rally's Timeline:** Start today (Jan 17) → Launch Week 8 (early March) = 7 weeks of engagement. Tight, but doable.

## Part 1: Create Product Hunt Profile

### Who Should Create the Account?

**Your wife** (Rally's founder) should create the account, NOT a generic "Rally Team" account.

**Why:** Product Hunt loves founder stories. Personal accounts get more engagement than brand accounts.

---

### Step-by-Step: Profile Setup

**1. Go to:** [producthunt.com/signup](https://producthunt.com/signup)

**2. Sign Up Method:**
- **Option A:** "Continue with Google" (Recommended - easiest)
  - Use wife's **personal Gmail** (not hello@rallyapp.me)
  - Why: Easier login, no password to remember
  
- **Option B:** Email signup
  - Use wife's personal email
  - Set strong password

**3. Choose Username:**
- **Format:** @[wife_firstname] or @[wife_firstname_lastname]
- **Example:** @sarah or @sarahsmith
- **Try to match Twitter:** If Twitter is @sarahbuilds, use same on PH
- **Check availability:** PH will show if username is taken

**4. Fill Profile Information:**

**Full Name:** Wife's full legal name  
- Example: "Sarah Johnson"
- Shows on profile, comments, launches

**Headline:** "Founder at MowWow Limited | Building Rally - Making reliable plans with friends"  
- 60 characters max
- Shows under name on profile
- **Template:** "Founder at [Company] | Building [AppName] - [Value prop]"

**Bio:** (Write in first person)
```
Founder at MowWow Limited, building Rally. Tired of flaky friends who say "I'll be there" and never show. Building an app to make showing up matter through reliability tracking and gamification.

Launching Rally soon 🚀 | rallyapp.me
```

**Website:** https://rallyapp.me

**Twitter:** @rallyapp (or leave blank for now, add later)

- **Same photo as Twitter/Instagram** for brand consistency

**5. Enable "I'm a maker" Badge:**
- Go to Settings → Profile
- Scroll to "I'm a maker" toggle
- ☑ Turn ON

**6. Follow Relevant People:**

**Status:** ☐ Product Hunt profile created and complete

## Part 2: Daily Engagement Strategy (Weeks 1-7)

### The Daily Routine (10-15 mins/day)

**Every day at the same time** (e.g., morning coffee, lunch break):

**1. Go to:** [producthunt.com](https://producthunt.com)

**2. Browse Today's Launches:**
- Scroll through 5-10 products
- Read descriptions, click through to websites
- **Pick 5 products** you genuinely find interesting

**3. Upvote 5-10 Products:**
- Click the "△ Upvote" button
- **Don't upvote everything** - PH tracks this, looks spammy
- **Only upvote** if you'd actually use it or it's well-made

**4. Leave 2-3 Thoughtful Comments:**
- **NOT:** "Great app! Good luck 🚀" (generic, low value)
- **YES:** Ask questions, share feedback, mention use case

**Example Good Comments:**

❌ **Bad:** "Looks great! Upvoted 👍"

✅ **Good:** "Love the minimalist UI! Quick question - how do you handle timezone differences for remote teams? That's been our biggest pain point with [competing product]. Upvoted!"

✅ **Good:** "This is exactly what I've been looking for! One suggestion: would be great to have Slack integration for notifications. Are you planning that?"

✅ **Good:** "Congrats on the launch! I run a 10-person squad that struggles with coordination. Does Rally work for larger groups, or is it optimized for smaller friend circles?"

**Why Good Comments Work:**
- Shows you actually used/understood the product
- Asks thoughtful question (maker will reply → conversation)
- Mentions pain point or use case (relatable)
- Ends with upvote mention (positive reinforcement)

**5. Engage with Replies:**
- If maker replies to your comment, respond back
- Build relationship, not just transactional engagement

**6. Optional: Share on Twitter**
- Tweet 1-2 PH products you loved
- Tag the maker, use #ProductHunt
- Builds goodwill (makers remember this)

## Part 4: What NOT to Do

### Common Product Hunt Mistakes:

❌ **Creating account day before launch**  
- Algorithm won't weight your network's upvotes
- Looks like coordinated vote manipulation

❌ **Only engaging on launch day**  
- "Hey, I launched! Please upvote!" = ignored
- Community spots this instantly

❌ **Generic comments**  
- "Great app! Good luck!" x100 = spam
- No value, no relationships built

❌ **Upvoting everything**  
- Product Hunt tracks this
- Flags as low-quality engagement

❌ **Asking for upvotes directly**  
- Violates PH guidelines
- Can get your launch penalized
- **Instead:** "I'd love your feedback" (implied ask)

❌ **Ignoring comments on your launch**  
- Algorithm tracks maker responsiveness
- Not replying = deprioritized

---

## Part 5: Building Your Launch Network

### Who to Connect With

**Weeks 1-3:** Follow makers who launch products similar to Rally:
- Social networking apps
- Productivity tools
- Community/group coordination apps

**How to find them:**
- Search Product Hunt for "social app," "productivity," "planning"
- Follow makers of products you genuinely like
- Engage with their launches (comment, upvote)

**Weeks 4-6:** Engage with makers who engage back:
- If someone replies to your comments, follow them
- Like their responses, continue conversation
- Build genuine relationships

**Week 7:** DM top relationships:
- "Hey [Name], loved your launch of [Product]. Rally is launching next week - would love your feedback when we go live!"
- **Don't explicitly ask for upvotes** - just invite feedback
- Many will upvote organically

---

## Part 6: What You're Building Toward (Week 8)

By launch day, you should have:
- ✅ 600+ followers (people who'll see your launch)
- ✅ 120+ comments left (relationships built)
- ✅ 50+ makers who know you (will upvote back)
- ✅ Product Hunt Ship subscribers (300-500 emails)
- ✅ "Maker" badge (credibility)

**This network becomes your launch day army.**
