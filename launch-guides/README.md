## 💡 Tips

- **Don't skip steps** - Each guide builds on the previous one
- **Start early** - Apple Developer approval takes 24-48 hours (sometimes longer)
- **Product Hunt engagement** - Needs 2 months of daily activity (10 mins/day) before launch
- **Beta testing** - Minimum 2 weeks, ideally 3-4 weeks
- **Launch day** - Wednesday at 12:01 AM PST is optimal (highest Product Hunt traffic)
