## 🚨 Red Flags & Common Mistakes

### Week 1 Pitfalls:
- ❌ Waiting until Week 3 to apply for Apple Developer (takes 24-48h)
- ❌ Using wrong email for App Store (use personal, not hello@)
- ❌ Creating all social accounts in 1 day (looks suspicious)
- ❌ Not starting Product Hunt engagement (need 2+ months)

### Week 3-4 Pitfalls:
- ❌ Writing store copy without ASO research
- ❌ Low-quality screenshots (simulator, not real devices)
- ❌ Generic app description ("Rally is a social app")

### Week 5-6 Pitfalls:
- ❌ Skipping beta testing (launch with bugs = 1-star reviews)
- ❌ Submitting to App Store on Friday (reviewers offline)
- ❌ Not preparing for rejection (15-20% get rejected)

### Week 8 Pitfalls:
- ❌ Launching on Friday/weekend (low Product Hunt traffic)
- ❌ Not replying to PH comments (algorithm penalty)
- ❌ Only posting on launch day (need 3x daily all week)

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Time Management:
- **Batch similar tasks** (create all social accounts in one sitting)
- **Product Hunt = daily habit** (10 mins with morning coffee)
- **Content = batch create** (film 5 TikToks in one session)
- **Protect Week 8** (clear your calendar, it's a sprint)

### Staying on Track:
- Set weekly check-in with yourself (Friday EOD review)
- Use this doc as your source of truth
- Don't skip ahead (each week builds on previous)
- Celebrate milestones (App Store approval = 🎉)

### When You're Behind:
- Week 1-2 delays = acceptable (Apple approval varies)
- Week 3-4 delays = cut content quantity, not quality
- Week 5-6 delays = push launch date, don't skip beta
- Week 7 delays = prepare for fast resubmit if rejected
