**Last Updated**: January 2026

## Priority 1: High Impact, Easy (Do First)

- [ ] **Add app mockup to hero section**
  - Need: iPhone/Android screenshots of main app screens
  - Where: Hero section, next to "Know Who Shows Up" headline
  - Tip: Show reliability score or squad view for immediate understanding

- [ ] **Add waitlist count or social proof**
  - Current: "Get Early Access" button with no context
  - Change to: "Join X+ Early Adopters" (update number weekly)
  - Alternative: "Be the first in [city] to build your score"

- [ ] **Add privacy reassurance line**
  - Where: Below "Location Check-in" in How It Works
  - Text: "Your location is only shared when you check in—never tracked"

## Priority 2: High Impact, Medium Effort (Do Before Launch)

- [ ] **Add testimonials section**
  - Need: 2-3 beta tester quotes
  - Format: Photo + name + quote + reliability tier badge
  - Example: "Finally, a way to prove I'm not the flaky friend." — Sarah, Platinum

- [ ] **Create feature hierarchy**
  - Lead with: Reliability Scores (unique value prop)
  - Second: Private Squads
  - Third: Leaderboards
  - Consider removing weakest 2 features to focus

- [ ] **Add "How It Works" screenshots**
  - Step 1: Squad creation screen
  - Step 2: Event creation screen
  - Step 3: Check-in screen
  - Step 4: Score/leaderboard screen

## Priority 3: Medium Impact (Do After Launch)

- [ ] **Add founder story section**
  - "Built by [name] after missing too many game nights"
  - Adds credibility and emotional connection
  - Can be short paragraph with photo

- [ ] **Create FAQ section**
  - Address objections: privacy, what if friends don't join, gaming the system
  - 5-6 questions max

- [ ] **Add secondary CTA option**
  - For skeptics who aren't ready to sign up
  - "See how it works" → video demo or interactive walkthrough

- [ ] **Add app store badges**
  - "Coming soon to iOS and Android"
  - Replace with actual badges post-launch

---

## Content Improvements

- [ ] **Problem section emotional escalation**
  - Current: Three equal scenarios (Jake, Sarah, Mike)
  - Add stakes: "You stopped inviting people. Then stopped planning entirely."
  - End with: "Sound familiar?"

- [ ] **Solution transition**
  - Add bridge: "What if you could prove you're reliable—without saying a word?"

- [ ] **Tier consequences**
  - Explain what happens at each tier
  - Example: "Platinum members get priority invites"

- [ ] **Clarify CTA**
  - Change: "Get Early Access"
  - To: "Join the waitlist. We'll email you when Rally launches."

## Screenshots Needed (Checklist)

Once app is ready, capture these screens:

- [ ] Home screen with upcoming events
- [ ] Reliability score display (preferably high tier)
- [ ] Squad view with members
- [ ] Event detail screen
- [ ] Check-in confirmation screen
- [ ] Leaderboard view
- [ ] Profile with badges

**Tip**: Use a demo account with good data, not empty states

## Technical Notes

- Hero mockup: Use device frame (iPhone 15 Pro recommended)
- Image optimization: WebP format, lazy load below fold
- Mobile responsive: Test all new sections on mobile first
- A/B test: Waitlist count vs. city-based CTA

---

## Post-Launch Additions

- [ ] Real user testimonials (replace beta quotes)
- [ ] Press mentions (if any)

- [ ] App store ratings widget
